### Hello and welcome! ðŸ‘‹
 
### About Me :cherry_blossom:

- :ringed_planet: I am Makenna Kidd, a Junior at Arizona State University. I am pursuing my Bachelors degree in **Computer Science** and I aim to graduate in May of 2023.

- :floppy_disk:**What am I working on?:** Although I have learned a handful of languages already such as Java, Matlab, Assembly, Prolog, Scheme, and C/C++...I am currently diving further into C/C++, Python, and Java development within my studies. With my classes, I am currently learning in depth algorithmic logistics in C++, hashing/encyrption/decryption in Python, team development within Java, and project management styles with tools such as Jira and Astah. Being so close to my graduation date, I am quite eager to finsih my schooling and showcase what I've learned in my future career. 
 
- :rainbow: **Future project plans:** Once my schooling is less hectic as this semester I have a packed schedule due to working part time and having 6 full time classes, I plan on working on personal projects to showcase my skills outside of my studies. I'm not sure exactly what I plan on doing yet, but I've had my mind set on making a small game of some sort using Java. One of my dreams is to make an idle story based game that also incorporates my digital art skills.

- :sparkles: **What I like to do for fun:** Outside of the tech world I enjoy pushing myself to learn new things and enjoy the small stuff life has to offer. I love improving my art skills such as **painting, drawing, and learning to do digital art**. I've picked up **roller skating** again and am striving to improve my tricks as well as my endurance level. When the weather permits, I enjoy being out in nature just to relax or get a tough hike in.
