- :floppy_disk:**What am I working on?:** Although I have learned a handful of languages already such as: Python, SQL, Java, Assembly, C/C++, Prolog, and Scheme... I am currently diving further into Python, SQL, Cybersecurity, Computer Forensics, and Management within my studies. Being fairly close to my graduation date, I am quite eager to finish my schooling and showcase what I've learned in my future career.
